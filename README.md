# Dockerfile Build Failure: Missing Dependencies or Incorrect File Paths

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: issues related to missing dependencies or incorrect file paths within the Dockerfile.  The provided `Dockerfile` contains an error that prevents successful image building. The `DockerfileSolution` offers a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The `Dockerfile` attempts to build an image that runs a Python application. However, it may fail to build because of one or more of the following reasons:

* **Missing Dependencies:**  The base image may not include necessary packages or libraries.  The `requirements.txt` file may be missing or incomplete.
* **Incorrect File Paths:** The `COPY` instructions might point to incorrect file locations.
* **Permissions:** Incorrect permissions on files could also prevent the Dockerfile from building correctly.

The error message provided during the build process will offer clues as to the specific problem.

## Solution

The `DockerfileSolution` provides a corrected version of the Dockerfile. This may involve:

* **Adding a proper base image:** Selecting a base image that already has python and pip installed. 
* **Ensuring requirements.txt exists and is accurate:** Make sure all necessary python packages are listed.
* **Verifying file paths:** Confirm that all paths are correct and point to existing files in the context of the Docker build.
* **Adding instructions to fix permissions:** In cases of permission errors you should make your files readable and executable by the correct users.
